# Sentiment_Analysis_BERT

A lightweight repo for fine-tuning a BERT model for sentiment analysis and running quick inferences. Built around a single Python script: `sentiment_analysis_using_bert_model.py`.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview  

This project demonstrates how to build a **sentiment analysis model** using **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**.  

- The script fine-tunes a pre-trained BERT model on a labeled dataset (text + sentiment labels).  
- It supports **training, evaluation, and inference** from the command line.  
- Training data typically consists of sentences/reviews labeled as **positive** or **negative**, but the pipeline can be adapted to multi-class sentiment tasks.  
- Once trained, the model can predict the sentiment of any given text input.  

**Why BERT?**  
Unlike traditional models, BERT is pre-trained on massive amounts of text and understands language context bidirectionally (both left and right). This makes it highly effective for NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, where nuance and context matter.  

**Use cases include:**  
- Classifying customer reviews as positive/negative.  
- Monitoring social media for brand sentiment.  
- Automating support ticket prioritization based on tone.
